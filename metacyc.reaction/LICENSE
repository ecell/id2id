SOFTWARE and DATABASE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Pathway Tools Software and BioCyc Database Collection

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED BELOW).

By clicking on the "I Agree" button at the bottom of this page, LICENSEE signifies assent to the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement (“Agreement”). If LICENSEE does not agree to these terms and conditions, please click on the "I Do Not Agree" button and do not continue to use this program. SRI International (“SRI”) reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify the terms of this license at any time; SRI will provide notice of such modifications to you through Pathway Tools, by electronic mail to the address used to register on biocyc.org, and/or by notices on biocyc.org – continued use of the software and databases will constitute agreement to the modified version of the terms.

OVERVIEW

A. Pathway Tools software is a bioinformatics software system for pathway analysis of genomes, and for creating pathway/genome databases (PGDBs). A PGDB is a bioinformatics database that integrates genomic data with detailed functional annotations of the genome, such as descriptions of metabolic and signaling pathways; and

B. Under this Agreement, LICENSEE is able to, among other things:

1) Create New Databases. Use Pathway Tools software to create new PGDBs, and redistribute those databases as files or register them in the SRI database registry for redistribution (as long as those databases are also hosted by LICENSEE on an external website, meaning a website that is accessible to the public);

2) Operate an External Website. Operate an external website using Pathway Tools software, where that website makes available any or all of the “open” BioCyc databases, and/or PGDBs created by LICENSEE;

3) Operate an Intranet Website. Operate a website on LICENSEE’s intranet using Pathway Tools software, where that website makes available any or all of the BioCyc databases and/or PGDBs created by LICENSEE (if that website contains any of the “limited” BioCyc databases, then the website may be used by a single laboratory, but not by a larger unit of LICENSEE’s organization such as a department); and

4) Create and Distribute Enhancements. Distribute additional software you create that interacts with the Pathway Tools software, as long as your software does not contain parts of Pathway Tools itself, or modifications of Pathway Tools. If you wish to distribute additional software that contains parts of Pathway Tools, or enhancements to Pathway Tools, LICENSEE must confirm with SRI that the person you wish to distribute to has a valid Pathway Tools software license.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth below, the parties hereby agree as follows:
